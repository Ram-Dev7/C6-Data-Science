for how to install your package manager as well as installing modules.

Open Terminal and type:
python3 -m pip --version

If it has not been installed type the following command to install:

python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

Once pip is installed, we proceed to install the package virtualenv:

python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv

Go to your project folder, the environment we want to create is going to be loacted in any specific path where your project is located

Type the following command:

cd /Users/username/Documents/

Create the virtual environment:

python3 -m venv _env1

(Here _env1 refers to the name of the environment, choose any of your choosing.)

Activate the virtual environment:
source _env1/bin/activate

To deactivate the environment simply type:
deactivate

To install spacy via pip type the following commands at a time:

pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
pip install -U spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

The final command will download the small English package. To download the medium sized package replace "en_core_web_sm" with "en_core_web_md"

Once the download is complete, navigate to VS Code. 
Since we've manually created our virtual environment, navigate to "View" then "Command Palette".
Select "Python: Select Interpreter". This command will display all available global environments and virtual environments. 

Select the virtual environment (env). 
If the environment is not listed you may specify the path by clicking "Enter interpreter path" then select "Find" to browse the file system.

You should be able to run the example.py file and start using the spaCy library
