    "# Introduction to NLP with spaCy\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. It enables computers to read, understand, and derive meaning from human languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy is a powerful and fast NLP library with pre-trained models for various languages, designed specifically for production use. spaCy helps us perform multiple NLP tasks, such as tokenization, named entity recognition (NER), and semantic similarity assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation and Setup\n",
    "Before we start, ensure that spaCy is installed and that you have downloaded the language model for English. If not, you can install spaCy and download the English model using the following commands:"
